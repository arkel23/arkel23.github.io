### About Me

My name's Edwin and I come from Panama. I did my undergrad studies in Energy Engineering. National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan.
Currently I'm pursuing a MSc in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan.

### Research Interests

Currently I'm working on applications of signal and image processing for biomedical purposes making use of deep learning and computer vision.

### Projects

- Remote Photoplethysmography (RPPG) studies. Done in C++ and Python for NCTU PCS Lab.
- Computer vision for autonomous driving. Done in Python making use of TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV, and ROS for Deep Learning course (108-1).  ![](https://arkel23.github.io/files/dl_demo.png) [Final Results](https://arkel23.github.io/files/dl_final.pdf) [VGG Paper Explanation Slides](https://arkel23.github.io/files/dl_vgg.pdf)
